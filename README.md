# UberProject

For this project I analyzed the data from 6 months during the year 2014 and the rides from Uber that took place. Throughout this project, I cleaned the data, extracted certain values into seperate columns and use that data to create graphs and models to help better understand how popular Uber was during this time.

# Dictionaryüìù
The main columns I used during this project were:

Base: the base where the ride was from

Lat: The latitude coordinate from the ride

Lon: The longitude coordinate from the ride

Month: The month in which the ride took place

Time: The time in which the ride took place

Date: The date in which the ride took place

Hour: The hour in which the ride took place

dayName: The day of the week in which the ride took place

weekNum: The week of the month in which the ride took place

# Data Cleaningüßπ
To first clean the data, I put in the month name and number to make it easily accessible
```R
aprilData$Month <- "April"
mayData$Month <- "May"
juneData$Month <- "June"
julyData$Month <- "July"
augustData$Month <- "August"
septemberData$Month <- "September"

aprilData$monthNum <- 4
mayData$monthNum <- 5
juneData$monthNum <- 6
julyData$monthNum <- 7
augustData$monthNum <- 8
septemberData$monthNum <- 9
```
Next, I put all the different tables into one by rbinding and pulled out certain data from the Date.Time column that I would later need.
```R
df_combined <- rbind(aprilData, mayData, juneData, julyData, augustData, septemberData)

df_combined$Time <- str_sub(df_combined$Date.Time, -8, -1)
df_combined$Date <- as.Date(df_combined$Date.Time, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
df_combined$Date <- as.numeric(str_sub(df_combined$Date, -2, -1))
df_combined$Hour <- as.numeric(str_sub(df_combined$Time, -8, -7))
```
After that, I made three new columns and pulled out that information from different columns as briefly shown below
```R
df_combined <- df_combined %>% 
  mutate(totalDay = NA, dayName = NA, weekNum = NA)

df_combined$totalDay <- ifelse(df_combined$Month == "May", df_combined$Date + 30, df_combined$Date)

df_combined$dayName <- ifelse(df_combined$totalDay %% 7 == 1, "Tuesday", df_combined$dayName)

df_combined$weekNum <- ifelse((df_combined$Month == "April" | df_combined$Month == "July") & df_combined$Date <= 31, 5, df_combined$weekNum)
```

# Creating Pivot Tables, Heat Maps and Charts
The next step after cleaning the data was to put it into Pivot Tables and Charts so the images of what exactly was happening could become more clear. Almost every Chart and Pivot Table code followed as similar format to the ones below, but differs from what exactly was being plotted:
```R
month_counts <- table(df_combined$Month)
barplot(month_counts[], xlim=c(0.4, 7), xlab="Month",
        ylim=c(0, max(month_counts)), ylab="Number of Rides", main="Month Count Chart", col = "Green")

hour_counts <- df_combined %>% group_by(Hour) %>% summarise(Count = n())
ggplot(hour_counts, aes(x=Hour, y=Count, fill=Hour)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  ggtitle("Count of Rides by Hour") +
  xlab("Hour") + ylab("Count")
  
daily_trips <- df_combined %>% group_by(Date) %>% summarise(Trips = n()) 
ggplot(daily_trips, aes(x = Date, y = Trips)) + 
  geom_line()
```

After the Pivot Tables and Charts were created, I made Heat Maps. All heat maps followed a similar format to the one below, but again differed in what was being plotted. 
```R
ggplot(df_combined, aes(x = Hour, y = Date)) +
  stat_bin2d(aes(fill = after_stat(count)), binwidth = c(1, 1)) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "blue") +
  ggtitle("Hour and Date") +
  labs(x = "Hour of Day", y = "Day of Month", fill = "Number of Trips")
```

# Prediction Model
In order to try and predict when rides would happen, I made a correlation chart. This chart sadly did not help me gain any knowledge in when rides would happen due to there being close to no correlation in every variable. This correlation chart was made through:
```R
df_cortable<-df_combined %>%
  select(Date, Hour, weekNum, Lat, Lon, monthNum)
head(df_cortable)
B<-cor(df_cortable)
head(round(B,2))
corrplot(B, method="color")
```
This table below shows how there was little to no correlation with all the variables:

# Leaflet Shiny Geospatial
The next part of this project was the create a simple Leaflet Shiny Geospatial, which I did through the following code:
```R
ui <- fluidPage(
  leafletOutput("map")
)

# Server
server <- function(input, output) {
  # Create a Leaflet map
  output$map <- renderLeaflet({
    leaflet(data = df_combined) %>% 
      # Add map tiles
      addTiles() %>% 
      # Add markers for each trip start location
      addMarkers(lng = df_combined$Lon, lat = df_combined$Lat)
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

# Shiny App
The last part that needed to be completed for this project was to make a Shiny App to show the graphs that were made through the project. This was completed through the following code:
```R
ui <- fluidPage(
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      selectInput(inputId = "plot_type", 
                  label = "Choose plot type:", 
                  choices = c("Trips by Month", 
                              "Trips by Hour", 
                              "Trips by Day",
                              "Trips by Hour and Month",
                              "Trips by Day of Week",
                              "Trips by Day of the Week and Month",
                              "Trips by Base and Month",
                              "Heat Map of Hour and Day of Week",
                              "Heat Map of Hour and Date",
                              "Heat Map of Month and Day of Week",
